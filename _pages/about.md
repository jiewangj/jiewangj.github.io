I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computing Science at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/), 
supervised by [Prof. Joemon M. Jose](https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~jj/). 
My research focuses on **AI Agent & Large Language Models**, with particular interests in 
**Reinforcement Learning**, **Personalization**, and **Multi-modal Recommendation & Information Retrieval**. 
I have been working closely with [Dr. Alexandros Karatzoglou](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=j5u5iiYAAAAJ) and 
[Dr. Ioannis Arapakis](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=iTkgXpoAAAAJ), who are expert industrial researchers, for long-term 
collaboration and mentorship throughout my Ph.D. journey. 

I completed research internships at **Tencent** and **Amazon** before.
I have published 14+ papers in top-tier conferences and journals, including SIGIR, CIKM, WSDM, ECIR, IEEE TKDE, and IEEE TPAMI. 

Research Interests
======
My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and information retrieval, with a focus on:

- **Large Language Models & AI Agents**: Leveraging LLMs for recommendation and information retrieval tasks
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Decision transformers, multi-objective optimization, and policy exploration for recommender systems
- **Personalization**: User preference modeling and personalized content generation
- **Multi-modal Learning**: Cross-modal retrieval, video understanding, and multi-modal recommendation systems
